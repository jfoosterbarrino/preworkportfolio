                    My name is Jalen Fooster-Barrino. I was born about 20 minutes north of Atlanta in Marietta, GA. I'm an only child from a single parent home. I grew up on the campus of the University of Georgia, my mom's alma mater, so I'm a huge Dawgs fan (National Champs btw). We moved back to Marietta while I was in Middle School and I attended Marietta High School. In high school, I dabbled in a little bit of everything. I was on the football team, track & field team, symphony band, student council, and started my own club for men of color at my school. My mom was also a teacher at the school I attended so I had no choice, but to be a honor student as well. My mom raised me to believe in discipline over motivation and it has served me well to this point. A quote that resonates with me is, "Today I will do what others won't, so tomorrow I can do what others cant." -Jerry Rice

                    Thanks to hardwork and a little luck, I was able to turn my grades and athletic accomplishments into a full scholarsip to the United States Air Force Academy. At the academy I was challenged in ways that I couldn't even imagine for 4 years. I don't know that I would do it again, but I'm glad that I did it. I learned lessons and skills that will carry with me the rest of my life. I majored in Civil Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's degree. I went on to serve as a Civil Engineer in the Air Force. After I got out I took a break from engineering and focused on another passion of mine, fitness. For the last few years, I've been the General Manager of a gym in the heart of Atlanta.

                     Growing up, my focus has always been sports. My first love was baseball. I think everybody has fond childhood memories playing their favorite sport and mine was baseball. Once I got to high school, it was football where I was the starting linebacker for our team. However, most of my accomplishments are in Track & Field. My events included hammer throw, javelin, discus, and shot put. I won the state championship in high school, got a full scholarship to college, and qualified for the collegiate national championships through this sport. Due to my active upbringing, my current hobbies include working out and playing any sport I possibly can. However, my favorite current hobby is flying. I have my private pilot's license so I fly recreationally which is something I picked up at the Air Force Academy and continued doing post-grad.

                    Professionally I really want to break into the tech industry and become a full-time software engineer. I have an engineering background, but no real tech experience. I know that this is one of the only industries that has consistent growth no matter what the social, economic, or political climate is. I believe I have the mind and passion for this type of work and I feel accomplshed everytime I create something from scratch that I can be proud of. In my personal life, my main goal is just to travel and see as much of the world as I can. I believe this career path and accomadate that as well.
